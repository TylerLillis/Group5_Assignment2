                    Now that we are in the modern period where technology is heavily relied upon, with the number of users and devices growing each day, technological internet-based threats are bound to be present considering the period. A question arises from the creation of these dangers: what exactly is protecting us from them? The very definition for cybersecurity is broad, mostly subjective, hence why one is established after gathering other definitions from multiple perspectives: “Cybersecurity is the organization and collection of resources, processes, and structures used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems from occurrences that misalign de jure from de facto property rights.” [1]<br><br>
                    Cyberattacks are not limited to only domestic households—not just viruses and malware sneaking their way through a family member’s personal computer after they had tried to access an incomplete website. The breadth of the problem is immense that millions are personally victimised by identity theft in the United States alone, reaching up to 14 million, which is due to distribution of personal information online. Governments invest their fundings into state-of-the-art technology to counter the growing threats many environments including but not limited to personal users, corporations, and infrastructure, face. Kavak et al. states that there are three components to cybersecurity: targets, threats, and preventative measures. Targets are those susceptible to threats and consist of three categories including data systems, Information Communications Technology (ICT), and the users themselves. Physical systems are usually not the main target, but the data stored inside. [2] Threats are anything that can have a negative impact on systems ranging from unstructured to structured: inexperienced individuals utilizing hacking tools to those who have deeper understanding of their target and can exploit and design codes. Common cyberattacks include physical attacks, denial of service (DoS), attacks on privacy, access attacks, and reconnaissance attacks. To briefly explain, physical attacks are when the hardware components are tampered with, usually when it is left unattended, making it the most vulnerable to attacks. Denial of service is, as the name puts it, the attempt to make a network or machine unavailable for its users. Attacks on privacy are a common threat due to the information available. Access attacks are those who intrude in spaces they are not meant to enter. They may be physical access to the device itself, or network access which can be done to any IP (Intellectual Property) connected devices.[3] <br><br>
                    These are usually oriented to target the data from users to sell the data or manipulate it, or to simply put, improve their skills. We produced the means called preventative measures so that we could stay safe from attacks, which can also be split into three types: technology, education, and policies. Technology is one of the most vital resources we have available; one of the more popular tools are antiviruses, programs known to detect trojans and viruses by using various techniques such as pattern matches, heuristics, even assessing the file sizes [4] and eliminating them. Another is packet sniffers used to detect any network intruders. [5] However, technology alone will not suffice in keeping us safe. Incidents mostly happen due to human error. Education is vital to avoiding falling into traps by informing users of how to respond to threats through basic safety training involving concepts like safe browsing, recognizing suspicious messages also known as phishing, password security, understanding software permissions, and secure data disposal, which links to the policies involved in cybersecurity. Training is not limited to unsuspecting family members and friends browsing the internet, but also organisations, since cyberspace is of significance in their operations. Policies are established to further enforce safety by describing responsibilities and sharing the best practices in navigating cyberspaces. Artificial intelligence and machine learning both also play a significant role in cybersecurity as it is being used to detect malicious behavior from hackers and teach them patterns of the network. [6]<br><br>
                    The presence of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning in cybersecurity will grow even more prominent soon. Cognitive systems based on AI help automate tasks and prepare for difficulties humans find too complex to solve. Since newer technologies develop from newer threats, where stronger approaches may be needed, traditional cybersecurity procedures might fail to keep up. They rely on Machine Learning by utilizing data from prior attacks to respond to newer threats. AI systems also bring the advantage of reducing time for IT employees. [7] Their efficiency will not replace cybersecurity specialists in the future, but instead help them complete tasks and strengthen their defenses against cyberattacks.[8] The workforce has also increased over the years due to demand and will continue to do so through education and training thanks to cybersecurity related programs that will help create a stronger and larger workforce ready to protect our cyberspaces. [9] <br><br>
                    Now looking upon the effects of cybersecurity on a much smaller scale—in our daily lives, we would want to get through our days and routines without any disruptions nor dangers. Being in the digital world is no different. The services cybersecurity provides to the public allow for safer and seamless navigation in cyber spaces. We can help those who are not well versed with technology by keeping them away from data breaches and hackers with the education and resources provided in the ever-growing field. Loved ones can be kept safe if they are taught not to fall for frauds as well as suspicious links, and even if they do, an antivirus per se can simply undo the damage done. Personally, being aware that I can safely navigate through the internet—the space I frequent the most—eases the anxiety of knowing the dangers that present itself in the digital world.<br><br>
