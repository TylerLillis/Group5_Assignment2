            <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h3>
            <div class="MainPanel">

                    Cryptocurrencies are a way for people to pay each other online with a currency whose value is based on what a user would offer and blockchains are a system that is used to record cryptocurrency-based transactions. The blockchains are stored on online networks and computers linked to peer-to-peer networks. These technologies were made to allow people to pay using an online coin rather than using traditional cash, but this so far has not been the case as people have been treating it more like stocks instead of a form of money. Most people who use cryptocurrency as a way of investing use a public blockchain allowing them to be the one in charge rather than having a middleman/Bookey. These technologies are likely to keep evolving and becoming bigger, with more people becoming aware and joining in on the trends. This behaviour increases the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoins and shows a need for private and consortium blockchains, which are managed by an individual or a company external to you. It is predicted by Avivah Litan that in the next couple of years companies will not stop investing in cryptocurrencies even though they are a risky investment, as they are still looking like the way of the future. This would then have them be advanced in the new version of currency and allow them to take over a bit. This would be possible if blockchains and cryptocurrencies follow the paths that they are predicted to follow and begin to take over the world and start becoming more of a normalised everyday currency. Unlike your “traditional financial assets” [4]  cryptocurrency can have a spill over of assets allowing for people to go back and mine for the currency again even after all of it had been originally found. This would in future allow for people to mine larger amounts of the currencies which if this becomes a national currency could become an issue like money printing, hence meaning that the world's economy would be highly volatile and very easy to break.<br><br>
                
                    These technologies could impact the future of banks and their employees as they would need to evolve from doing in-person business to learning how to adapt to online versions of currency. Whilst that is already happening, this would have to be advanced more than it already is and become more of a consortium blockchain allowing for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin so that they do not become completely redundant. But whilst that group of people may be able to keep their jobs as long as they adapt, accountants might begin facing difficulty as they need to adapt to a new form of currency due to the world economy possibly changing. This would force them into having to learn how to use new systems and even start using different forms of blockchains. Any business based on current forms of money, especially those that continue to use cash rather than an online banking system would struggle and run the possibility of becoming redundant. This could put a vast number of people out of work and not open more jobs as those who get lucky and do not go out of the job will just fill the new gaps straight away and not create any more openings for those who completely lose them. Since the system will be done online there would be less need for a large staff force to keep the business working smoothly.<br><br>
            
                    This may affect me as taking payments would need to evolve to allow for taking cryptocurrency on top of the already standing online and card-based payment systems. This would mean that many industries in a comparable situation would need to adapt online payments in-store so that they can be adaptive to the innovative technologies. This could affect my family as there are accountants and they may run the risk of losing their jobs, and they do not have a good enough grasp on most technologies making it harder for them to pick up the new versions that may come around.<br>
