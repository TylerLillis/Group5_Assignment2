                    What do Robots do? <br><br>
                    The word “robot” originated in the 1920s at first as a type of slave and often characterized by their dull and dangerous tasks (Jordan John, 2005) and is derived from the Czech word robota (“forced labour” or “serf”) (Gratz & Michaels, 2018)<br><br>
                    Robots are defined by the Robotics Industry Association (RIA) as non-living physical agents and are reprogrammable and multifunction manipulators designed to move tools, materials, or specific devices via programmed motions to perform a variety of tasks. Without a set of codes telling them what to do, they are quite simple machinery because robots do not have human-like intelligence. Robots have diverse types of classifications according to the Robotics Institute of America, this then includes a variable-sequence robot that performs stages of tasks, a method that is easily modified. Another example is an intelligent robot that can understand its environment is completes the tasks even in a different environment. There is also a playback robot where a human operates and leads it to perform its task manually. And lastly, a numerical control robot that identifies the movement program of the human operator rather than doing it manually. Robots are usually just thought of as science-fiction where this could only be seen in movies such as Star Wars R2 – D2, terminator, Robocop, transformers including Optimus Prime, and Disney’s Wall-E. But then, robotic developers and researchers discovered that robots can be used in a real-world setting in which would become helpful for many the humans’ tasks to be easier. Correspondingly, robots would need electrical components that use power to control the machinery inside them, and for instance, robots need electrical currents, specifically a battery. Honda Motor Corporation had made a robot named ASIMO and it has been dubbed the world’s most advanced robot. With its humanoid appearance, ASIMO can walk and climb stairs, and it is a PR (PERSONAL ROBOT) device whose function is for domestic settings. Elsewhere, at Carnegie Mellon University, researchers have created a snake-like robot. (“What is the most advanced robot around today?”)  and the University of California at Berkeley, they have also been working on robots that are the size of insects. As described, it has been undoubtedly impressive for ASIMO’s human-like ability. However, these snake-like and insect-sized robots can overpower ASIMO’s tasks. Many types of robots have been developed throughout time. The first one on the list was an autonomous robot, this robot has a few of its subtasks such as its ability to generate a specific task motion, having a filter and noise sensor that helps it to cope with uncertainty, and its ability to understand the model of mechanism including Kinematics, Dynamics and Odometry. Typically, kinematics which is an English version of the French word cińemalique from Greek κίνηση (movement) that is a branch of science that analyzes the motion without the attention that has caused the motion, it describes how the robots’ joints configuration can be translated into locations throughout the world. The next one was the traditional industrial robots that are usually used in mechanics and machinery and automotive projects, its control uses large robotic arms and pre-computed motions such as repetitive and high-speed tasks, sensing operations, high precision movements, having task policies and no interactions with humans. Yet these robots lack capabilities and still do not have any intelligence like humans since they only have limited sensing and know that they do not have any interactions with humans, and only rely on the perfect task information that is given to them. Conversely, some robots can be in an intelligent environment, and these are comprised of Assistant robots like ASIMO which has been mentioned before that are programmed for people who have disabilities, mobility, and service of other people. And service robots like delivery, cleaning, mowing and security guards.<br><br>
                    What is the impact?<br><br>
                    As the innovation of robots emerges and continues to progress, people can say that there are a lot of Pros and Cons that are associated with them. Robots are known to become beneficial for warehouses and factory workers as this helps with manufacturing where repetitive tasks are needed for the production line. Additionally, robots can also help humans with disabilities by helping them with smaller tasks they cannot do on their own, likewise having a personal service such as vacuum cleaners, and Lawnmowers. Moreover, robots are made not only for manufacturing but also for transportation including self-steering vehicles, Autonomous helicopters that deliver objects from various locations that are dangerous or hard to access, and for transportation of foods. Robots are also used for hazardous environments and assist for Toxic waste cleanup, or deep-sea recovery. Similarly, robotics is being used in healthcare, developing a nurse Bot that is intended to help and guide individuals and assist with instrument placement when operating organs (insights, 2021). However, despite the many beneficial abilities of robots, they can also become a burden when they are the only ones who do everything. As a result, humans are left with nothing to do, which will lead to many people being unemployed as fewer and fewer humans are needed for industry work because robots and machinery make their job easier and even faster. Thus, replacing all the current human jobs. Due to loss of employment because of work automation, this becomes another issue for the growing number of workers and professionals, and it is beyond their concern that causes them anxiety and insecurity for their workplace to significantly change, since robots are taking up their workplace and therefore, they might need time to adjust for its growing numbers. Another negative effect of robots entering a workforce is that it may enhance the risk of data breach and may other cybersecurity issues. If companies and businesses will continue to replace their conventional workers with software applications and equipment’s that are accessible wirelessly without addressing any safety concerns and digital security, this may result to an increased risk of data breach as innovative technologies are continuously developing, this could also become an easily inviting target for data breachers.<br><br>
                    How will this affect you? <br><br>
                    Living in a widespread technology and the thoughts of living with it every day of our lives, it is undeniable that robots can become extremely helpful to us nowadays, especially if all people want is to make their life easier and work faster having to spend less time and energy to their everyday wellbeing. It might be different from what we have grown up with from the past generation, but this is what people have predicted that we might have in the future. However, as life gets so much easier because of having these robots and machineries, this should not be the reason why other people are becoming inactive and become negligent that they only rely on all the things the robots can do even if they can do simple things by themselves. I do not want our generation to just rely on technologies all throughout our lives and it is still much better to do things that we normally do without relying on these robotic technologies. The researcher’s aim of making robots is not to replace humans but to free us from our workloads and most basic and low-level tasks that do not require human intelligence. Since the production and development of robots are continuing to grow, it might have an impact for us future generation and sometimes makes us worry about our opportunities for our future employment. It is because robots may fill up all the roles of the industry fields in the future even the medical and healthcare fields and professions, therefore humans like us are now seen as useless. In accordance with what is likely to happen in the future, and the continuously innovation of technology, some jobs such as telemarketing, Automated Shipping services, Librarians and Library technicians and many more are assumed to be done by robots therefore it no longer need an actual human being to do the works today and in the future.<br><br>
