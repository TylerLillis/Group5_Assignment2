                <p>Hi! My name is Princess Abbey Jabadan. I’m a Filipina, born and raise from the Philippines. I’m Bilingual, I can speak Tagalog and English Language.  I enjoy listening to K-pop music, I also love doing arts and crafts, drawing, and painting as these things makes me feel relax whenever I feel overwhelmed. I have been interested in technology since I was young the reason why I pursue IT course as want to explore and expand my knowledge more about it.</p>

                    <p>Having a Protagonist personality can mean that I can have positive impact among my groupmates. Some of the strengths of my personality is being able to allow my members to express and grow themselves fully, and not letting them down reassuring that they can count on me on some of the responsibilities even when it's difficult to do so. These results would also help me to learn more about my personality and have a better understanding of how I can influence my group and how to improve some of my weaknesses when participating in this team.</p>

                <p>Hello, my name is Chelsie Anday. I am born in the Philippines but graduated high school in the UAE; I can speak both Tagalog and English with proficiency.  I enjoy melting my brain over video games, books, and drawing, as well as technology which is why I decided to pursue IT.  I look forward to learning about many facets of technology throughout this course and beyond!</p>

                    <p>With the three personal tests coalesced, similarities and correlations can be drawn from the results. My creative nature is reflected through the three tests, with me being a visual learner as well as being an INFP. The low extraversion percentages highlight my introverted nature, and while I can provide creative insights for my team, I would prefer straying from leadership roles and instead working with the rest of the team as a regular member.</p>

                <p>Hi, my name is Zachary Stokeld. I’m Australian born and raised with Portuguese heritage but can only speak the language broken. I’m big into sports and statistics, as well as games (video and board), and love travelling. My interest in IT only began a few years ago after dropping out of an arts degree, and I started experimenting with different areas of interest, and I landed on IT. I really enjoy programming and it is the biggest reason I started having an interest.</p>

                    <p>I think these test results indicate that I my preferred method of working is collaboration, as working within a group is something that brings out some of my strengths. My mediator personality type indicates I am a people pleaser, and that my despite being an introvert, I do my best work when someone is relying on me. Furthermore, group work helps reign in some of my more unfocused tendencies, while my flexibility allows me fulfill roles as needed.</p>

                <p>Hi! I'm Will Dash. I was born in Australia, and I only know English. During my free time, I indulge myself in a large variety of physical and computer games, creative activities, anime/manga, cosplay, and spending time with friends. Despite my submissiveness, I’ve always been passionate towards anything technology and I enjoy learning and helping others with computers and hope to pursue a career in something IT related. </p>

                    <p>I think these test results will be helpful to the group as these results accurately reflect my behavior when in a team, which is mostly introverted and preferring to do individual work over teamwork but still able to communicate with other team members and collaborate effectively. I also believe this data demonstrates that I am not well suited towards a team-leader position and instead work better as a regular team member. </p>

I’m Australian born with close Maltese background but have absolutely no clue how to speak a word of that language anymore even though I tried learning.

                <p>My opinion towards becoming a software developer has not changed despite the data. I do understand that my ideal job requires me to learn a set of programming languages and I am willing to hone the skills I already possess to be qualified in the job such as the attention to detail, which can help with writing code and debugging. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="InDataHeading" style="margin-left: 0; margin-top: 40px;">Has your opinion changed after looking at this data? (Zachery)</h2>
                <p>This information has not changed my opinion about becoming a software developer. I have a long way to go in not only learning specific programming languages, but also with the general skills that are required, as I am inexperienced at working in a professional team environment and my organizational skills require much refining. However, my enjoyment of problem solving and mathematics still lead this to be an ideal job for myself </p>

                <p>No, my opinion hasn’t changed. Even though I will have to learn multiple different coding languages, operating systems and how networking works on a deeper level, I am still interested in building my skill sets to the point where I am qualified for this job. In fact, some of the general and IT-specific skills that I was not completely aware of being demanded for this kind of job are abilities that I already show interest in. For example, I enjoy designing presentations and going into detail and I am interested in the finer details of networking as I had to teach myself some of it when creating my own server.</p>

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>
                <p>Josh works for (NMSP) Many service Providers, supplying corporate support to approximately 30- 40 businesses across Melbourne and offices across the country and a few overseas as well.</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Please tell us about the industry you work in</h2>
                <p>They also call for IT supports, anything from window supports, up to employing in a tiny office including infrastructures, service support, cloud support across the entire businesses, any IT service required by their clients will come through them where appropriate. They limit themselves in terms of Telephony support, they are not involved in it just because it requires a far more specialist skill set</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>
                <p>They do some programming and support products, and software supports, such as what many people find in many industries not just a simple as Microsoft Office but when people are paying 30,000 dollars - 100,000 dollars a year those sorts of software programs are usually supported by a distributor for that program. The common one that most people know is AutoCAD where there are 3 companies in Australia that if people want AutoCAD those are the 3 companies that they must go to and when they need support they speak to those companies and not to them. However, they tend to support those companies more often than the companies who are paid to do it. And then they do some programming and some website support as well even though it is not really under their purview. They do have some clients that have internal IT teams, and they also supply additional support to them, but they are often project-based work where it is entirely outside of the technical knowledge of the IT person onsite.</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. (He also had answered Question 6 “interactions with clients or investors” in this question)</h2>
                <p>Primarily at the professional standpoint its on a support basis they would deal with other IT professionals when they are trying to supply a support to one of their clients and it overlaps with something that they manage on behalf of the client so whether that’s an infrastructure support whether that's working with an ISP to getting Internet setup at a new site or existing site, could also be the printer guys making sure that the networks are setup so that they can add their devices as required. A software support company when they are having issues they can work with them to resolve their problem.</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>
                <p>Josh interacts with other IT people, whom he met through the industry, and he also went onto other businesses, so he kept in touch with those people, not on a professional level but just support for a particular device software infrastructure.</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2>
                <p>Josh said that he probably spends most of his time on networking service support, such as deploying and maintaining new network service or troubleshooting within network or service.</p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>
                <p>He states that the biggest challenges that he finds in the industry are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>people’s ability to speak and communicate effectively to others as they can end up with people who are quite rude and abrupt, they mean nothing by it and just do not have people skills and end up causing more issues than it solves.</li>
                    <li>The ability to manage clients rather than tickets and being able to convey what you need across multiple skill sets.</li>
                    <li>The need to be able to cater to all forms of knowledge and they find it in their experience across the industry that's the biggest thing that people fall short of.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>
                <p>There are two things with the essence of what they do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixing issues and problems</li>
                    <li>Managing the people that are having the problems in which there are multiple ways they can handle a situation, you can be very abrupt and arrogant in a way of answering client questions or answering it in such a way that everybody feels like they had their issue heard, understood and fixed. As well as making sure that people are leaving on a positive note that they are willing to report any further issues to you down the track</li>

            <div class="MainPanel">
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>Our project idea is an interactive program that informs and tests the knowledge of the users on basic cyber security practices and everyday security practices that should be followed on all internet of things devices. The aim is to build this program in Python and explain all of the necessary information in an easy to understand and coherent manner. Specifically, we want the program to be modular, to allow the easy addition of information as required, and to include basic text information on these security practices as well as an interactive section that will quiz the user on the information it has previously explained in the aim for the user to retain that knowledge. We believe that a program, rather than a website has the flexibility and the modularity that is required to properly educate users in an interactive digital environment.</p>

                    <h5>Motivation</h5>
                    <p>This project is useful because it will be aimed at teaching in an easy-to-understand manner to allow almost any level of computer knowledge to be able to use and understand the information contained in the program. “Attacks on the Internet of Things devices will increase rapidly due to hypergrowth in the number of connected objects, poor security hygiene, and the high value of data on IoT devices”<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212567115010771">(Sciencedirect.com, 2015, page 26 para. 2)</a>, this rise in attacks really exemplifies the need to educate people who aren’t as knowledgeable about tech and inform them how they can protect themselves. Especially due to the increasing reliance on devices to perform everyday activities. we decided to pick this project specifically as it strongly connects to two of our member’s ideal jobs as a Cybersecurity Specialist and a Cyber Security Analyst through informing others on how they can improve their system’s security and will require us to thoroughly research these practices to be able to explain them in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.</p>

                <div class="ProjectPanel">
                    <h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
                    <p><b>Python</b> - For this program, we plan to write it in Python. This is due to us already being somewhat familiar with it while also being a language that can run on Windows, macOS and Linux enabling anyone running these operating systems to use the program. (Might consider TempleOS for version 2.0) <br><br>
                    
                    <b>PyQt5</b> – This is the python UI module we plan to use for the UI of the program. We picked this because while it does have a steeper learning curve than other UI modules, it is much more robust and highly customizable to better suit our needs. Whereas a module such as Tkinter is too basic and harder to make it suit our needs. A designer application has also been developed for PyQt5 which would allow us to create the UI relatively easily without having to manually code each aspect of the interface (which would be really time consuming).<br><br> 
                        
                    <b>XML.etree.ElementTree</b> – Python module that will be used to parse data from the XML file where descriptions, questions and answers will be stored.<br><br>
                        
                    <b>PC</b> – Any computer would be required to run the program </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="MainPanel">
                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>We have decided to include the following features in our program:
                    <br><br><b>Teaching/Testing sections</b><br>
                    We want the two major features of the program to be to explain various security practices to the user and to test their knowledge afterwards as a method of retaining the information. For the teaching section, we will aim to include short and simple explanations alongside diagrams and other visual imagery to improve understanding, all the teaching sections will be categorized under online safety, privacy, social media/communication safety, device safety, and password safety. Online safety will focus on installing adblockers and their importance, safe use of online shopping and trusted online marketplaces and basic scams to look out for and avoid. Privacy will focus on how you can keep your personal information safe by splitting accounts and services across different emails, using different aliases to avoid being profiled online, and important settings to look for within services that keep the information you give to a minimum. Social media/communication safety will focus on identifying suspicious or phishing emails and to avoid blindly trusting strangers online. Device safety will focus on the importance of an antivirus encryption and why it is necessary and creating backups of important documents. Password safety will focus on the use of password managers and why they are important. A potential limitation of this section is the possibility of giving too much information too quickly or just confusing the user. To mitigate this problem, word choice and diagrams need to be carefully created to be simple enough to understand, but still correct. For the testing section, the aim is to keep a record of which sections the user has been through and give them multiple-choice questions related to those topics, the questions will be pre-written and randomized in the order they are given to the user to disallow them remembering the order of the answers over the information.
                    <br><br><b>Modularity</b><br>
                    To avoid having to hard code in each page and question into the program, we aim to make the program modular by instead reading the data that contains descriptions, questions, and answers from a storage format such as an XML file. This will make it quite easy to update or make changes to the content in the program. Images can be stored in a separate folder. A potential drawback is it may be hard to indicate where a certain image or diagram is placed, and it may overcomplicate the creation of the program beyond our abilities.
                    <br><br><b>Focus on the UI</b><br>
                    Having a clean, easy to use UI will be essential for this program. This is due to the wide range of abilities with computers that the users will have, we do not want to confuse or turn away potential users. In the creation of the UI, we will also have to take accessibility into account to accommodate for more people. Eg, larger text to accommodate for the degradation of an elderly person’s sight. We plan to minimize the amount of UI elements shown on the screen to avoid making the users lost or confused on where to click, using accent colours to identify key components that clearly contrast with the background and reduce distractions.<br><br>
                    For the UI in this project, our team has decided to implement Google’s Material Design 2 system theme as it is a well-known standard among applications and it is simplistic in design. Which is suitable for our planned userbase. We decided to avoid other popular UI trends such as Neumorphism and Glassmorphism as they are not as well established or known as Material Design so they would provide our users with a consistent experience with something that they are more likely to recognize. Also, material design is under the Apache-2.0 license so it is free to use without any legal issues.
                    <br><br><b>Computers over mobile devices</b><br>
                    We plan to make this a program that can be run on a PC over a phone application as most of the information we plan to explain to the user can be applied most effectively on a PC. Whereas mobile devices are currently a lot safer than PCs due to being more locked down (eg. Hard to install 3rd party apps on iOS, need to turn on a setting for Android) and security features are being integrated into newer systems. In addition to this, the program will be installed via executable, a feature that may assist users who are unfamiliar with the practice of extracting files. Some drawbacks we can identify due to this decision is the inability for our program to reach anyone who does not own a computer and the requirement to install this program beforehand may confuse potential users.
                    <br><br><b>Reward System</b><br>
                    To maintain the user’s attention to the program, we will be introducing gamification into the project, which is linked to Chelsie’s project idea, by incorporating an achievement-based reward system. Since the program revolves around teaching and informing users on cybersecurity practices, it may be difficult to keep users engaged as they progress through the teaching sections. Adding a feature that allows for achievements—trophies at the end of every section can give those learning cybersecurity practices a sense of accomplishment after learning valuable information.

                    <h5>Skills Required</h5>
                    <p>The skills required for this project would mainly include knowledge in the python programming language, extending to writing UI code through the PyQt5 module along with parsing data through an XML module. These skills could be acquired through video tutorials found on YouTube, or digital learning platforms such as w3schools.com. Another avenue for gaining these skills is joining online programming communities, such as stackoverflow.com, which allows users to ask and answer programming-based questions. Also, knowledge of good UI practices would be necessary to create a fluent and understandable user interface. This can be done through the reading of books by notable experts in the field such as Dr. Jacob Nielson, and other contemporaries, whose writings outline the fundamental principles of user design.  Knowledge of good cyber security practices would be essential before being able to explain the appropriate knowledge to the user without flaws. This knowledge could be achieved through various readings and analysis of peer-reviewed journals and other academic articles relating to the field of cyber-security. These skills are reasonably feasible and would take on estimate two or three months to learn from scratch. This is due to the bulk of the learning-based around understanding python and its modules.</p>

                    <h5>Outcome</h5>
                    <p>The intended outcome for this project is to inform as many potential victims of cybercrime as possible. Realistically, this project won’t create a massive impact on those affected by cyberattacks but the more people who have this knowledge and understand these concepts, the better. The original problem would be solved by teaching vulnerable people how they can keep themselves safe online and hopefully leading to them applying these practices or avoiding getting scammed/attacked due to the information that the program covers.</p>
